# OpenShift and GitOps - Part 2: Advanced Topics with Argo CD and Kustomize

Waaaaaay back (April 16, 2020), I did a demo of [OpenShift with Argo CD for GitOps](https://github.com/demo-thursday/gitops-kustomize-argocd).  This was an intro that covered some basic topics including tools such as Kustomize and Argo CD.

A lot has happened since then!  It's time to dive back into GitOps with a few more advanced topics.  This will include:

* Red Hat [joining the Argo CD project](https://blog.argoproj.io/red-hat-and-intuit-join-forces-on-argo-project-3442e9ae9bd8)
* New OpenShift GitOps integrations (starting in OpenShift 4.6) driven by Argo CD
* Beyond managing apps: OpenShift cluster configuration with GitOps
* How GitOps can be used to install operators - including some `Job` tricks.
* How to get started - Export your first app as YAML and **Kustomize** it!

Hopefully we'll have lots of time for Q&A as well.
